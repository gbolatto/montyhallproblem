# montyhallproblem

Saw a post about the monty hall problem and decided to make a small game of it and also simulate runs of it.

Haven't programmed in a few years so wanted to try getting back into it.

monty_hall_game.py  is the user played version.

monty_hall_game_sim.py is the simulation - just input your number of runs.

example results:
